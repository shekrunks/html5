                The latest version of Cascade Style Sheets, CSS 3, was developed to make Web design easier but it became a hot topic for a while because not all browsers supported it. However, trends change quickly in technology and all browser makers currently are implementing complete CSS 3 support. Making that process easier for the browser manufacturers is CSS 3's modularized specification, which allows them to provide support for modules incrementally without having to perform major refactoring of the browsers' codebases. The modularization concept not only makes the process of approving individual CSS 3 modules easier and faster, but it also makes documenting the spec easier.

Eventually, CSS 3 -- along with HTML5 -- are going to be the future of the web. You should begin making your Web pages compatible with these latest specifications. In this article, I explore 10 of the exciting new features in CSS 3, which is going to change the way developers who used CSS2 build websites.
Rounded corner elements can spruce up a website, but creating a rounded corner requires a designer to write a lot of code. Adjusting the height, width and positioning of these elements is a never-ending chore because any change in content can break them.

CSS 3 addresses this problem by introducing the border-radius property, which gives you the same rounded-corner effect and you don't have to write all the code. Here are examples for displaying rounded corners in different places of a website.
Another exciting feature in CSS 3 is the ability to swap out a border with an image. The property border-image allows you to specify an image to display instead of a plain solid-colored border.
